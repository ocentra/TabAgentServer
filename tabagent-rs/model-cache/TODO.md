# Model Cache - TODO

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Implementation (COMPLETE)

- [x] Error types (ModelCacheError)
- [x] Manifest types (ManifestEntry, QuantStatus, QuantInfo)
- [x] ChunkStorage implementation (5MB chunks)
- [x] FileMetadata tracking
- [x] ModelDownloader (HuggingFace API)
- [x] Progressive download with callbacks
- [x] ModelCache orchestration layer
- [x] Repo scanning and manifest generation
- [x] Quant variant detection
- [x] Basic tests

## 🔄 Phase 2: Testing & Validation (IN PROGRESS)

- [ ] Integration test with real HuggingFace download
- [ ] Test large file chunking (>1GB models)
- [ ] Test multiple quant variants
- [ ] Test concurrent downloads
- [ ] Benchmark chunk reconstruction speed
- [ ] Memory usage profiling during downloads

## 📋 Phase 3: Enhancements (PENDING)

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Parallel chunk downloads (multi-threaded)
- [ ] Resume interrupted downloads (ETag support)
- [ ] Chunk compression (reduce storage footprint)
- [ ] LRU eviction policy (auto-delete old models)
- [ ] Memory-mapped file serving for large files

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Delta updates (only download changed chunks)
- [ ] Mirror support (custom CDN endpoints)
- [ ] Offline mode (serve from cache only)
- [ ] Bandwidth throttling (respect network limits)
- [ ] Hash verification (SHA256 checksums)

### Multi-Model Support
- [ ] Support non-HuggingFace sources (local files, S3)
- [ ] GGUF-specific handling (llama.cpp models)
- [ ] SafeTensors support (PyTorch checkpoints)
- [ ] Model conversion pipelines (ONNX → GGUF)

## 🚀 Phase 4: Production Features (FUTURE)

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Download speed metrics
- [ ] Cache hit/miss rates
- [ ] Storage usage alerts
- [ ] Failed download retry logic
- [ ] Health check API

### Multi-Client Coordination
- [ ] WebRTC data channel serving
- [ ] Peer-to-peer model sharing
- [ ] Load balancing across multiple caches
- [ ] Distributed cache invalidation

### Platform Integration
- [ ] Platform-specific storage paths (AppData, Library, etc.)
- [ ] Low-disk-space handling
- [ ] Background download scheduling
- [ ] OS power mode awareness (defer downloads on battery)

## 🐛 Known Issues

- ⚠️ No resume support for interrupted downloads
- ⚠️ Large files (>8GB) may cause memory pressure during reconstruction
- ⚠️ No automatic cleanup of old/unused models

## 📊 Progress

- **Phase 1 (Core)**: ✅ 100% Complete
- **Phase 2 (Testing)**: 🟡 20% Complete (basic tests only)
- **Phase 3 (Enhancements)**: 🔴 0% (not started)
- **Overall**: **FUNCTIONAL** - Core API works, needs testing & polish

## 🔗 Integration Status

- [x] Rust API complete
- [x] PyO3 bindings created (see model-cache-bindings)
- [ ] Python native_host.py integration
- [ ] Web UI progress display
- [ ] CLI tool for manual cache management
