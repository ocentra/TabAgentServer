# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for building a modern React + TypeScript dashboard for TabAgent server. The dashboard will provide a beautiful, real-time interface for monitoring system status, managing models, viewing logs, and exploring data - replacing the current basic HTML dashboard with a professional-grade web application.

**Current State Analysis:**
- Basic static HTML dashboard at `/` with limited functionality
- Static links to API documentation and demos
- No real-time data or interactive features
- Basic styling with inline CSS
- Manual status checking via JavaScript fetch calls

**Target State:**
- Modern React + TypeScript single-page application
- Real-time data updates via WebSocket and HTTP APIs
- Interactive components for logs, models, database, and system monitoring
- Professional UI/UX with modern design system
- Type-safe integration with TabAgent APIs
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## Glossary

- **Dashboard_App**: React + TypeScript single-page application for TabAgent management
- **Real_Time_Updates**: Live data streaming via WebSocket connections and polling
- **Component_Library**: Reusable React components for dashboard functionality
- **API_Client**: TypeScript client for TabAgent HTTP and WebSocket APIs
- **Build_System**: Vite-based build pipeline for development and production
- **Design_System**: Consistent styling using Tailwind CSS and component library
