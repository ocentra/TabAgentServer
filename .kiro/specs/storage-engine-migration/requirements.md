# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for migrating MIA's core storage layer from the current `sled`/`bincode` implementation to a high-performance `libmdbx`/`rkyv` stack. This migration aims to achieve zero-copy reads, improved concurrency, and significant performance gains while maintaining system stability and data integrity throughout the transition.

**Current State Analysis:**
- Storage uses `sled` embedded database with `bincode` serialization
- Data models in `common::models` use `serde::{Serialize, Deserialize}` derives
- Values crate uses `serde` for API data structures  
- StorageManager provides CRUD operations with optional indexing integration
- Multi-tier architecture with DatabaseType and TemperatureTier support
- Comprehensive test suite with 43 tests (10 unit + 18 integration + 15 doc)

**Target State:**
- Replace `sled` with `libmdbx` for zero-copy MVCC database operations
- Replace `bincode`/`serde` with `rkyv` for zero-copy deserialization
- Maintain identical API surface and functionality
- Preserve multi-tier architecture and indexing integration

## Glossary

- **Storage_Engine**: The abstract interface that defines database operations for MIA's storage layer
- **SledEngine**: Compatibility wrapper implementing Storage_Engine for the existing sled database
- **MdbxEngine**: New implementation of Storage_Engine using libmdbx database
- **StorageManager**: Core component managing database operations and transactions (currently in storage/src/storage_manager.rs)
- **Migration_Tool**: Standalone utility for transferring data between storage formats
- **Zero_Copy_Read**: Direct memory mapping of serialized data without deserialization overhead
- **MVCC**: Multi-Version Concurrency Control providing concurrent read access
- **DatabaseCoordinator**: Multi-tier database management component (currently in storage/src/coordinator.rs)
- **IndexManager**: Optional indexing component from indexing crate

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to abstract the storage engine interface, so that I can safely migrate between different database implementations without disrupting the application logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Storage_Engine SHALL define a complete interface for all database operations including get, put, delete, and transaction management
2. THE SledEngine SHALL implement the Storage_Engine interface as a compatibility wrapper around the existing sled database
3. THE StorageManager SHALL be refactored to operate generically over any Storage_Engine implementation
4. THE system SHALL maintain identical functionality when using either SledEngine or MdbxEngine implementations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to convert data models to use rkyv serialization, so that the system can achieve zero-copy deserialization performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE common crate SHALL replace serde derives with rkyv Archive, Deserialize, and Serialize derives for all Node variants, Edge, Embedding, and ID types
2. THE values crate SHALL convert API data structures from serde to rkyv serialization while maintaining utoipa schema generation compatibility
3. THE system SHALL handle serde_json::Value metadata fields by providing rkyv-compatible alternatives or conversion layers
4. THE converted data models SHALL maintain identical functional behavior with existing StorageManager CRUD operations
5. THE system SHALL preserve existing bincode::Encode and bincode::Decode derives where they coexist with serde derives

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a new libmdbx-based storage engine, so that the system can achieve superior performance and concurrency characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE MdbxEngine SHALL implement the Storage_Engine interface using libmdbx database operations with identical method signatures to SledEngine
2. THE MdbxEngine SHALL provide multi-reader, single-writer MVCC concurrency model compatible with existing multi-threaded usage patterns
3. THE MdbxEngine SHALL support zero-copy reads through direct memory mapping of rkyv-serialized data
4. THE MdbxEngine SHALL maintain compatibility with existing DatabaseType and TemperatureTier multi-tier architecture
5. THE MdbxEngine SHALL pass all existing storage tests (43 tests) plus additional libmdbx-specific validation tests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want seamless data migration capabilities, so that existing data can be safely transferred to the new storage format without loss or corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Migration_Tool SHALL read data from existing sled/bincode databases
2. THE Migration_Tool SHALL write data to new libmdbx/rkyv databases with identical content
3. THE Migration_Tool SHALL validate data integrity during the migration process
4. THE Migration_Tool SHALL provide progress reporting and error handling for large datasets

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing and validation, so that the migration maintains system reliability and introduces no regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL pass all existing storage tests (10 unit + 18 integration + 15 doc tests) when using the new MdbxEngine
2. THE migration process SHALL be validated through A/B testing between SledEngine and MdbxEngine implementations
3. THE system SHALL provide rollback capabilities by maintaining SledEngine compatibility wrapper during transition
4. THE integration SHALL be verified through performance benchmarks demonstrating zero-copy read improvements and MVCC concurrency gains
5. THE system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing indexing integration and DatabaseCoordinator multi-tier operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a maintenance developer, I want clean removal of legacy components, so that the codebase remains maintainable after successful migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL remove sled dependencies after successful migration validation
2. THE SledEngine compatibility wrapper SHALL be deleted after migration completion
3. THE documentation SHALL be updated to reflect the new libmdbx/rkyv architecture
4. THE codebase SHALL contain no unused legacy storage-related code after cleanup
