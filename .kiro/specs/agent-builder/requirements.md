# Agent Builder Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Agent Builder is a visual workflow editor inspired by n8n, designed to enable users to create complex AI agent pipelines, automation workflows, and RAG systems through a drag-and-drop interface. This system will integrate with the existing TabAgent ecosystem, allowing browser extension users and dashboard users to visually construct and execute agent workflows.

## Glossary

- **Agent_Builder**: The visual workflow editor application built with Vue 3 + Vue Flow
- **TabAgent_Server**: The existing Rust backend server that provides APIs and data management
- **Workflow**: A visual graph of connected nodes representing an automated process or AI agent pipeline
- **Node**: A single processing unit in a workflow (AI model, data connector, logic operation, etc.)
- **Connection**: A link between two nodes that defines data flow direction
- **Canvas**: The main visual editing area where users drag, drop, and connect nodes
- **Extension**: The browser extension that can open the Agent Builder in a new tab
- **Dashboard**: The existing React-based monitoring and control interface

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Visual Workflow Editor

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create AI agent workflows using a visual drag-and-drop interface, so that I can build complex automation without writing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the Agent Builder, THE Agent_Builder SHALL display a canvas with drag-and-drop capabilities
2. WHEN a user drags a node from the node library, THE Agent_Builder SHALL allow placement on the canvas
3. WHEN a user connects two nodes, THE Agent_Builder SHALL create a visual connection line between them
4. WHEN a user selects a node, THE Agent_Builder SHALL display a properties panel for configuration
5. THE Agent_Builder SHALL support zoom, pan, and minimap navigation of the canvas

### Requirement 2: Node Library and Types

**User Story:** As a user, I want access to various node types including AI models, data connectors, and logic operations, so that I can build comprehensive agent workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Agent_Builder SHALL provide a node library with categorized node types
2. THE Agent_Builder SHALL include AI/LLM nodes for GPT, Claude, and other models
3. THE Agent_Builder SHALL include data connector nodes for Google, Email, Asana, and other services
4. THE Agent_Builder SHALL include logic nodes for conditions, loops, and data transformation
5. THE Agent_Builder SHALL include trigger nodes for webhooks, schedules, and manual execution

### Requirement 3: TabAgent Server Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want my workflows to connect with existing TabAgent resources like models and databases, so that I can leverage the current system capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures an AI node, THE Agent_Builder SHALL fetch available models from TabAgent_Server
2. WHEN a user saves a workflow, THE Agent_Builder SHALL store workflow data via TabAgent_Server APIs
3. WHEN a user executes a workflow, THE Agent_Builder SHALL send execution requests to TabAgent_Server
4. THE Agent_Builder SHALL display real-time execution status via WebSocket connections
5. THE Agent_Builder SHALL integrate with existing database and logging systems

### Requirement 4: Extension and Dashboard Integration

**User Story:** As an extension user, I want to access the Agent Builder from my browser extension, so that I can create workflows within my browsing context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the Agent Builder button in the extension, THE Extension SHALL open Agent_Builder in a new tab
2. THE Agent_Builder SHALL be accessible via the Dashboard as a new page route
3. THE Agent_Builder SHALL maintain session state across different access methods
4. THE Agent_Builder SHALL support both standalone and embedded usage modes
5. THE Agent_Builder SHALL communicate with TabAgent_Server regardless of access method

### Requirement 5: Workflow Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save, load, and manage my workflows, so that I can reuse and share my agent configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user saves a workflow, THE Agent_Builder SHALL persist the workflow JSON to TabAgent_Server
2. WHEN a user loads a workflow, THE Agent_Builder SHALL restore the visual canvas state
3. THE Agent_Builder SHALL provide workflow versioning and history tracking
4. THE Agent_Builder SHALL support workflow import and export functionality
5. THE Agent_Builder SHALL allow workflow sharing and collaboration features

### Requirement 6: Execution Engine

**User Story:** As a user, I want to execute my workflows and see real-time results, so that I can test and validate my agent configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user executes a workflow, THE Agent_Builder SHALL process nodes in the correct dependency order
2. THE Agent_Builder SHALL display execution progress and status for each node
3. THE Agent_Builder SHALL show execution results and data flow between nodes
4. THE Agent_Builder SHALL provide error handling and debugging information
5. THE Agent_Builder SHALL support both manual and automated workflow execution

### Requirement 7: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want a beautiful and intuitive interface similar to n8n, so that I can efficiently create and manage workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Agent_Builder SHALL replicate n8n's visual design language and color scheme
2. THE Agent_Builder SHALL provide responsive design for desktop and tablet usage
3. THE Agent_Builder SHALL include keyboard shortcuts for common operations
4. THE Agent_Builder SHALL provide contextual menus and tooltips for guidance
5. THE Agent_Builder SHALL support dark and light theme modes

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Agent Builder to handle large workflows efficiently, so that I can create complex multi-step agent processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Agent_Builder SHALL render workflows with up to 100 nodes without performance degradation
2. THE Agent_Builder SHALL provide virtualization for large node libraries
3. THE Agent_Builder SHALL optimize canvas rendering for smooth interactions
4. THE Agent_Builder SHALL implement efficient state management for workflow data
5. THE Agent_Builder SHALL support lazy loading of node configurations and data
