# MediaPipe Desktop Examples

This directory contains MediaPipe example applications for desktop. See [Solutions](https://solutions.mediapipe.dev)for details.

### Execute on CPU

To run examples on the CPU, the `BUILD` file within each specific example
directory (for example, `face_detection/BUILD`) typically includes a sample
command. This command demonstrates how to run the example and pass the necessary
parameters, such as the graph configuration file and input/output paths.

### Execute on GPU

For information on setting up and running examples on the GPU, see the official
MediaPipe GPU support documentation: [Solutions](https://solutions.mediapipe.dev).
This guide details how to configure your environment for GPU-accelerated
MediaPipe graphs.
