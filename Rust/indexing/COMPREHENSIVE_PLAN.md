# Hybrid Indexing Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a hybrid indexing approach that combines the best features of in-memory and persistent storage systems. The approach leverages petgraph for complex graph algorithms and implements quantization techniques for memory efficiency.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths of Current Implementation
1. **Structural Indexes**: B-tree based property indexing with O(log n) lookups
2. **Graph Indexes**: Adjacency list implementation with O(1) neighbor lookups
3. **Vector Indexes**: HNSW-based semantic search with O(log n) performance
4. **Automatic Synchronization**: Indexes updated automatically with data changes

### Limitations of Current Implementation
1. **No Advanced Graph Algorithms**: Only basic adjacency list operations, no Dijkstra, A*, MST, etc.
2. **No Memory Efficiency**: Vectors stored as full f32 arrays without quantization
3. **No Tiered Storage**: All indexes are either in-memory or persistent, no temperature-based tiering
4. **Limited Query Capabilities**: No complex graph traversals or pattern matching

## Hybrid Indexing Requirements

### 1. Temperature-Based Tiering
- **Hot Layer**: Frequently accessed data in memory (Redis/petgraph style)
- **Warm Layer**: Occasionally accessed data with lazy loading
- **Cold Layer**: Rarely accessed data stored persistently

### 2. Advanced Graph Algorithms
- **Shortest Path**: Dijkstra, A* algorithms
- **Connectivity**: Strongly connected components, MST
- **Pattern Matching**: Complex graph traversal patterns
- **Centrality**: PageRank, betweenness, closeness

### 3. Memory Efficiency
- **Vector Quantization**: Scalar and product quantization for 8-bit storage
- **Graph Compression**: Efficient graph representation
- **Adaptive Caching**: Automatic promotion/demotion based on access patterns

### 4. Enterprise Features
- **Advanced Filtering**: Complex boolean expressions
- **Hybrid Search**: Combine structural, graph, and semantic queries
- **Real-time Updates**: Efficient index maintenance
- **Scalability**: Handle millions of nodes/edges/vectors

# Hybrid Indexing Implementation Impact Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the impact of implementing hybrid indexing on the MIA system architecture. The hybrid indexing approach will affect multiple interconnected crates and requires careful consideration of dependencies, interfaces, and backward compatibility.

## Affected Crates

### Direct Dependencies (Crates that depend on indexing)
1. **storage** - Core storage layer with automatic indexing integration
2. **query** - Query engine that uses IndexManager for converged queries
3. **weaver** - Knowledge enrichment system that creates and uses indexes
4. **db-bindings** - Python bindings that expose indexing functionality

### Indirect Dependencies (Crates that may be affected)
1. **common** - Shared types and models used across all crates
2. **task-scheduler** - May need to coordinate with indexing operations
3. **pipeline** - May use indexing for data processing

## Detailed Impact Analysis

### 1. Storage Crate Impact

#### Current Usage
- The StorageManager creates and maintains an optional IndexManager instance
- All CRUD operations automatically update indexes when indexing is enabled:
  - `insert_node()` → `index_node()`
  - `delete_node()` → `unindex_node()`
  - `insert_edge()` → `index_edge()`
  - `delete_edge()` → `unindex_edge()`
  - `insert_embedding()` → `index_embedding()`
  - `delete_embedding()` → `unindex_embedding()`

#### Impact Considerations
- **Backward Compatibility**: Must maintain existing IndexManager API
- **Index Synchronization**: Hybrid indexes must integrate with existing synchronization logic
- **Performance**: Hot layer operations should not slow down existing operations
- **Memory Management**: Tiered storage may require additional memory management

#### Required Changes
1. Extend StorageManager to support hybrid index initialization
2. Update index synchronization logic to work with tiered indexes
3. Add configuration options for hybrid indexing features
4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing IndexManager API

### 2. Query Crate Impact

#### Current Usage
- QueryManager holds a reference to IndexManager for query execution
- Uses IndexManager for:
  - Structural filtering via `get_nodes_by_property()`
  - Graph traversal via `get_outgoing_edges()` and `get_incoming_edges()`
  - Semantic search via `search_vectors()`

#### Impact Considerations
- **Query Performance**: Hybrid indexes should improve query performance
- **API Consistency**: Query API should remain unchanged
- **Tiered Querying**: May need to support temperature-based query routing
- **Complex Queries**: Advanced graph algorithms should be accessible through query interface

#### Required Changes
1. Extend query models to support hybrid index features
2. Update query execution logic to leverage hybrid indexes
3. Add support for advanced graph algorithms (shortest path, etc.)
4. Maintain existing query API for backward compatibility

### 3. Weaver Crate Impact

#### Current Usage
- WeaverContext creates separate IndexManager instances for conversations and knowledge databases
- Uses indexes for:
  - Entity linking and similarity searches
  - Semantic indexing operations
  - Knowledge graph enrichment

#### Impact Considerations
- **Enrichment Quality**: Hybrid indexes should improve enrichment accuracy
- **Performance**: Faster indexing operations should speed up enrichment
- **Memory Usage**: Tiered storage may reduce memory footprint
- **Algorithm Access**: Weaver modules should be able to use advanced graph algorithms

#### Required Changes
1. Update WeaverContext to support hybrid index initialization
2. Extend enrichment modules to leverage advanced graph algorithms
3. Optimize memory usage with tiered storage
4. Maintain existing enrichment workflows

### 4. DB-Bindings Crate Impact

#### Current Usage
- Exposes database functionality to Python via PyO3
- Provides Python wrappers for core database operations
- May expose indexing functionality through Python API

#### Impact Considerations
- **Python API**: Hybrid indexing features should be accessible from Python
- **Performance**: Python bindings should benefit from improved indexing performance
- **Compatibility**: Existing Python code should continue to work
- **Documentation**: Python API documentation needs updates

#### Required Changes
1. Extend Python bindings to expose hybrid indexing features
2. Update Python API documentation
3. Add Python examples for hybrid indexing
4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing Python API

## Interface Changes

### Public API Modifications

#### IndexManager Extensions
The existing IndexManager will be extended with new methods while maintaining backward compatibility:

```rust
impl IndexManager {
    // Existing methods remain unchanged
    pub fn new(db: &sled::Db) -> DbResult<Self> { ... }
    pub fn index_node(&self, node: &Node) -> DbResult<()> { ... }
    // ... other existing methods
    
    // New hybrid indexing methods
    pub fn get_hot_graph_index(&self) -> Option<&HotGraphIndex> { ... }
    pub fn get_hot_vector_index(&self) -> Option<&HotVectorIndex> { ... }
    pub fn dijkstra_shortest_path(&self, start: &str, end: &str) -> Option<(Vec<NodeId>, u32)> { ... }
    pub fn astar_path(&self, start: &str, end: &str) -> Option<(Vec<NodeId>, u32)> { ... }
    pub fn strongly_connected_components(&self) -> Vec<Vec<NodeId>> { ... }
}
```
