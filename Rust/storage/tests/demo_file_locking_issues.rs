//! DEMONSTRATION tests showing file locking issues we had initially
//!
//! ⚠️ WARNING: THESE TESTS VERIFY EXPECTED FAILURES! ⚠️
//!
//! These tests demonstrate the problems we encountered before implementing proper test isolation.
//! They are designed to fail with specific file locking errors, which proves the protection is working.
//!
//! If these tests pass, that would indicate a problem with the locking mechanism.
//! If these tests fail with file locking errors, that's CORRECT - it means the protection is working.
