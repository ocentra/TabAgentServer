# Hardware Detection - TODO

## ✅ Phase 1: CPU Detection (COMPLETE)

- [x] CpuArchitecture enum (AMD/Intel/ARM variants)
- [x] Windows detection via PowerShell Get-CimInstance
- [x] Linux detection via /proc/cpuinfo
- [x] macOS detection via sysctl
- [x] CPU family/model/stepping parsing
- [x] Match to known architectures
- [x] Fallback to generic detection
- [x] Binary path generation
- [x] Basic tests
- [x] Zero warnings compilation

## 🔄 Phase 2: GPU Detection (PARTIAL)

- [x] GPU module structure (gpu.rs)
- [ ] NVIDIA CUDA detection
- [ ] AMD ROCm detection
- [ ] Intel Arc detection
- [ ] Vulkan capability detection
- [ ] VRAM size detection
- [ ] Multi-GPU enumeration
- [ ] Device selection logic

## 📋 Phase 3: Advanced Features (PENDING)

### Extended CPU Detection
- [ ] Precise AVX-512 variant detection (VNNI, BF16, etc.)
- [ ] ARM NEON capabilities
- [ ] CPU cache size detection
- [ ] TDP/power limits
- [ ] Thermal throttling detection

### Extended GPU Detection
- [ ] CUDA compute capability
- [ ] Vulkan API version
- [ ] DirectX feature level (Windows)
- [ ] Metal version (macOS)
- [ ] GPU clock speeds
- [ ] Memory bandwidth

### Binary Selection Logic
- [ ] Priority system (prefer GPU > CPU-AVX512 > CPU-AVX2)
- [ ] Benchmark-based selection
- [ ] User override support
- [ ] Fallback chain (try best, then next best, etc.)

## 🚀 Phase 4: Production Features (FUTURE)

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] CPU usage tracking
- [ ] GPU utilization tracking
- [ ] Temperature monitoring
- [ ] Power consumption tracking
- [ ] Thermal throttling detection

### Platform Integration
- [ ] Windows: WMI alternative to PowerShell
- [ ] Linux: lscpu integration
- [ ] macOS: IOKit for detailed GPU info
- [ ] Docker/container detection
- [ ] VM detection (Hyper-V, VMware, etc.)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Hardware capability caching
- [ ] Benchmark suite for binary selection
- [ ] Auto-update binary paths on hardware change
- [ ] Cloud platform detection (AWS, Azure, GCP)

## 🐛 Known Issues

- ⚠️ PowerShell overhead on Windows first call (~50ms)
- ⚠️ No GPU detection implemented yet
- ⚠️ Limited ARM architecture variants
- ⚠️ No fallback chain for missing binaries

## 📊 Progress

- **Phase 1 (CPU)**: ✅ 100% Complete
- **Phase 2 (GPU)**: 🟡 10% Complete (structure only)
- **Phase 3 (Advanced)**: 🔴 0% (not started)
- **Overall**: **FUNCTIONAL** - CPU detection works perfectly, GPU pending

## 🔗 Integration Status

- [x] Rust API complete
