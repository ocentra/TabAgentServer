# Storage Crate - TODO

## âœ… Completed

### Phase 1: Core Storage
- [x] StorageManager implementation
- [x] Node CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- [x] Edge CRUD operations
- [x] Embedding CRUD operations
- [x] Binary serialization with bincode
- [x] Transaction support via db() method
- [x] Batch operations (get_nodes, insert_nodes_transactional)
- [x] Test cleanup with tempfile::TempDir
- [x] 4 unit tests passing
- [x] 18 integration tests passing

### Phase 2: Index Integration
- [x] Optional IndexManager integration
- [x] Two-mode operation (new vs with_indexing)
- [x] Automatic index updates on insert_node
- [x] Automatic index updates on delete_node
- [x] Automatic index updates on insert_edge
- [x] Automatic index updates on delete_edge
- [x] Automatic index updates on insert_embedding
- [x] Automatic index updates on unindex_embedding
- [x] index_manager() accessor method
- [x] 9 doc tests passing

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Bulk insert optimizations
- [ ] Read-through caching for hot nodes
- [ ] Connection pooling for concurrent access
- [ ] Metrics/instrumentation (insert times, cache hit rates)

### Features
- [ ] Node update method (vs re-insert)
- [ ] Soft delete support (mark as deleted vs actually delete)
- [ ] Database compaction/maintenance methods
- [ ] Export/import for backup/restore

### Integration
- [ ] Task scheduler integration (async CRUD)
- [ ] PyO3 bindings (Phase 4)
- [ ] Transaction-level index updates (Phase 3)
